## UltraPrx Info
My latest project released to the public after days of development is named UltraPrx, a possible but shut down name idea was UnblPrx. After many design changes, edits, and figuring out the file locations of stuff because the project is forked from a static version of UltraViolet. The code is currently closed-source for now but a open beta is available at https://ultraprx.vercel.app/static/ An open version of the project is planned to release but may just never be released.
